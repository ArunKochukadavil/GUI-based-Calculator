# GUI-based-Calculator
Hey guys if you are using this source code just see to it that it may have bugs as this was just my first approach to make calculator by pure coding (i.e not using the drag and drop module in netbeans) using JFrame.
Happy to accept any comments if you find any bugs as it will help me make it better and bugs free.
